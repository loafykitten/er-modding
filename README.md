# er-modding
This repo contains all of my Elden Ring modding work. What you're viewing now is the source code. You can find each latest release of my mod listed below.

All mods require [me³ / Mod Engine 3](https://github.com/garyttierney/me3). You may be able to use them with earlier versions of mod engine, but that'll be your responsibility to manage.

All mods can technically be installed by cloning this repo and running the mod profile of your choosing if me³ is installed. For example, Classes Expanded would just need you to double click the classes-expanded.me3 file. If running by the terminal, you would `cd` to the root directory and run `me3 launch -p [mod-profile].me3`.

Specific mods can be installed by going to its specific latest release link, contained in its section below.

Classes Expanded is a mod that adds new starting classes to the game:
